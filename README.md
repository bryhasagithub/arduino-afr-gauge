# The adventures of redesigning the AFR gauge

I'm starting to develop a custom air-fuel ratio powered with an LCD display on Arduino Uno and o2 wideband sensor! The reason why I feel so inclined to recreate the AFR gauge is because to me, the existing digital ones on the market haven't changed much since they were first introduced. They all look stuck in time - the 2 fast and 2 furious time period. The digital display and LEDS looks outdated and it's time for a change - especially with all the advancements in technology that we as a society have made since those first digital AFR.

**WARNING - Still all in progress and README will be updated once everything works. Don't assume this is a functioning end to end system (yet)**
